## Notes

- Malak is at threshold of 1-2 for wild surges


## Straflan Sewers Collapse

- Malak and pit of zinoplasm fall through the ground into the middle of the sewers
  - the zinoplasm charges the water with lightning:
    - when crossing water or ending turn in water, must make a DC13 Acrobatics check
    - failing check or ending turn in water results in 1d8 lightning damage, and target can't take reactions until the start of its next turn
- large chunks of stone begin falling from sewer ceilings
  - **[TODO]** develop roll table for how/where these chunks fall
  - some of these chunks definitely fall and kill whatever/whoever is guarding wildling slaves
    - this results in slave revolt that further adds to the chaos

- **[TODO]** How does Zilug react to what's happening?
- **[TODO]** Decide how many Kumerovians/lizardfolk are with Zilug, and which **important** Kumerovians are there (if any)
