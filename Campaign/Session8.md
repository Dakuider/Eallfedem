## Notes

- Malak is at threshold of 1-2 for wild surges


## Straflan Sewers Collapse

- large chunks of stone begin falling from sewer ceilings
  - **[TODO]** develop roll table for how/where these chunks fall
  - some of these chunks definitely fall and kill whatever/whoever is guarding wildling slaves
    - this results in slave revolt that further adds to the chaos
- **[TODO]** does Malak and the zinoplasm from the pit fall through the ground into the fighting pit portion of the sewers?

- **[TODO]** How does Zilug react to what's happening?
- **[TODO]** Decide how many Kumerovians/lizardfolk are with Zilug, and which **important** Kumerovians are there (if any)
