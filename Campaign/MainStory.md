# Main Story

## Backstory

1. There was a group researchers (humans) from the northeastern province of Arcmont called Kumerov that studied Zinoplasm during the Calamitous War to try and weaponize it.
1. Most of researchers and their research was destroyed during The Fall, but some survived.
1. The lingering Kumerov researchers were steeped in grief over the lost of their province and loved ones, and continued their research when they relocated to Ironbrook in 2962 AE.
1. The War of Bhelvaengr decimated Ironbrook in 3647 AE, including much of the Kumerov researchers' work.
1. The few Kumerov researchers who were left escaped into the Vetrupyr Wastes and travelled along the foot of the mountains, eventually stumbling across a Young Blue Dragon named Avnal.
Rather than fight Avnal, they decided to make a pact with Avnal:
  - Avnal would grant their three most adept magic users sorcerous powers
  - In return, The Three would ally their forces with Avnal to bring destruction and tyranny to the civilized world
1. Allied with Avnal, The Three and their forces travelled back to Ironbrook to establish their dominance over the resident wildlings and conscripting them to work the mine that Ironbrook was named after.
  - There were portions of this mine that were cordoned off because of the uncovering of zinoplasm, but these fonts of the magical material were now the focus of the miners' work.
  - This mine also provided The Three and their researchers with the materials they needed to study zinoplasm (such as platinum).

## Anval's Baptism

- In a recent ceremony developed by the Kumerov researchers, Avnal was baptized in a pit of zinoplasm.
- This ceremony had several results:
  - Avnal had all of the secrets of zinoplasm unlocked to him
  - Avnal was bestowed with the seemingly divine power to create zinoplasm using a magical breath ability
  - Avnal, drunk on this power, declared that his followers be named Avnal's Chosen, and all must worship and obey him
- While the wildlings and The Three's researchers were quick to accept this leadership change, The Three themselves were wary because it seemed to shift the power entirely into Avnal's hands.


## Present Time

-  The researchers have recently become successful in weaponizing zinoplasm because of newfound platinum in the mine they have the wildlings working. 
- They've used these weapons to arm some of the wildlings and unite them under their cause of wreaking destruction on the civilized world.
- At the direction of the researchers, the wildlings have been taking the weapons out into the Scarred Lands to test them on various monsters and tribes that don't want to join them.

## Goal of Bad Guys

Destroy the civilizations of the world, and stand alongside Avnal to rule what's left over.
They are trying to achieve this goal by performing tests with stronger and stronger weapons until they feel like they have enough power to test their weapons on the cities belonging to the League of Sheriffs.

## Plot Hooks

The weapon tests that the wildlings have been performing are driving the other inhabitants of the Scarred Lands west, causing conflict with the people belonging to the League of Sheriffs.

## Increasing Stakes

The Scarred Lands conflicts will start with lesser challenges and progress to more difficult combat based on how powerful the wildlings' weapons are becoming.

## The End

Players battle sorcerers and their patron dragon in the irradiated lair of Avnal.
