# Main Story

## Backstory

1. There was a group researchers (humans) from the northeastern province of Arcmont called Kumerov that studied Zinoplasm during the Calamitous War to try and weaponize it.
1. Most of researchers and their research was destroyed during The Fall, but some survived.
1. The lingering Kumerov researchers were steeped in grief over the lost of their province and loved ones, and continued their research when they relocated to Ironbrook in 2962 AE.
1. The War of Bhelvaengr decimated Ironbrook in 3647 AE, including much of the Kumerov researchers' work.
1. The few Kumerov researchers who were left escaped into the Vetrupyr Wastes and travelled along the foot of the mountains, eventually stumbling across a Young Blue Dragon named Avnal.
Rather than fight Avnal, they decided to make a pact with Avnal: in exchange for the sorcerous power necessary to harness Zinoplasm, they would serve Avnal by decimating society and helping her rule over what's left.
    - Blue Dragon fits here because they inhabit deserts/badlands (i.e. Vetrupyr Wastes)
    - Blue Dragons == lightening damage which is a lot of what Zinoplasm does
    - Avnal's layer is located in the wastes near a Zinoplasm mine.
    Said location is about 40 miles west-north-west of Ironbrook.
1. The Kumerov researchers would eventually re-adopt Ironbrook as their home, making use of the desolation of the War of Bhelvaengr by conscripting the survivors of Ironbrook to work the mine the town was named after.

## Present Time

-  The researchers have recently become successful in weaponizing zinoplasm because of newfound platinum in the mine they have the wildlings working. 
- They've used these weapons to arm some of the wildlings and unite them under their cause of wreaking destruction on the civilized world.
- At the direction of the researchers, the wildlings have been taking the weapons out into the Scarred Lands to test them on various monsters and tribes that don't want to join them.

## Goal of Bad Guys

Destroy the civilizations of the world, and stand alongside Avnal to rule what's left over.
They are trying to achieve this goal by performing tests with stronger and stronger weapons until they feel like they have enough power to test their weapons on the cities belonging to the League of Sheriffs.

## Plot Hooks

The weapon tests that the wildlings have been performing are driving the other inhabitants of the Scarred Lands west, causing conflict with the people belonging to the League of Sheriffs.

## Increasing Stakes

The Scarred Lands conflicts will start with lesser challenges and progress to more difficult combat based on how powerful the wildlings' weapons are becoming.

## The End

Players battle sorcerers and their patron dragon in the irradiated lair of Avnal.
