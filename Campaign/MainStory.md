# Main Story

## Backstory: 2693 - 4262

1. There was a group researchers (humans) from the northeastern province of Arcmont called Kumerov that studied Zinoplasm during the Calamitous War to try and weaponize it.
1. Most of researchers and their research was destroyed during The Fall, but some survived.
1. The lingering Kumerov researchers were steeped in grief over the lost of their province and loved ones, and continued their research when they relocated to Ironbrook in 2962 AE.
1. The War of Bhelvaengr decimated Ironbrook in 3647 AE, including much of the Kumerov researchers' work.
1. The few Kumerov researchers who were left escaped into the Vetrupyr Wastes and travelled along the foot of the mountains, eventually stumbling across a Young Blue Dragon named Avnal.
Rather than fight Avnal, they decided to make a pact with Avnal:
  - Avnal would grant their three most adept magic users sorcerous powers
  - In return, The Three would ally their forces with Avnal to bring destruction and tyranny to the civilized world
1. Allied with Avnal, The Three and their forces (The Kumerovian Triad) travelled back to Ironbrook to establish it as their base of research operations.
  - They conscripted the lizardfolk that were residents of the Dirkenmos Forest using their reverence of Avnal to work the mine that Ironbrook was named after.
  - There were portions of this mine that were cordoned off because of the uncovering of zinoplasm, but these fonts of the magical material were now the focus of the miners' work.
  - This mine also provided The Three and their researchers with the materials they needed to study zinoplasm (such as platinum).
1. As time would pass, members of The Three would pass away, and were either replaced with
  - their offspring if they inherited the sorcerous power
  - the next most powerful magic user, granted new sorcerous power by Avnal

## Elyas' Birth: 4262AE

- Elyas' dad Murtaz is one of The Three and his mother Sonya is a Kumerov researcher.
- Murtaz was first to have the idea to experiment with zinoplasm on animals.
  - Yelena Kasradze was his apprentice, but wanted to steal his work/credit and killed him during one of the experiments.
  - Yelena takes Murtaz' place on The Three.
- Sonya feared for her and Elyas' life so she ran away shortly after this.

## Devden's Discovery: 4272AE

Malak's mother Zoya is one of the Kumerov researchers.
The Order of the Tome sensed Avnal's power growing, but were unsure of what it was and sent Malak's father Devden to investigate.
Realizing the danger posed by the Order of the Tome, The Three satiated Deven's questions about the zinoplasm resources without telling him _why_ they were researching.
During his time there, Devden ended up falling in love with Malak's mother Zoya, a researcher.

## Elyas Skips Town: 4272AE

Elyas accidentally kills his friend at the age of 9 using his latent sorcerous powers, and flees town fearing retribution.

## Malak's Birth: 4273AE

While Malak is growing inside Zoya, she allows Yelena to conduct experiments because of the latent magical power that resides in elven blood.
Malak's birth was gruesome due to the magic caused by these experiments and Zoya died in childbirth.
  - **[REVIEW]**: does she though? Devden said otherwise...
Enraged by being lied to, and fearing for Malak's safety, Devden fled with Malak to Tomespire.
Thinking it would be the safest place, Devden left Malak in the hands of the Mirhem Academy while he continued his own research on zinoplasm.

## Orcish Expansion: 3662 - present

The orcs of the Strael Mountains began pushing into the Scarred Lands after the War with Bhelvaengr weakened the peoples there.
As time has passed, the orcs' population has grown and their territory has spread further and further from the Strael mountains.

## Grimdash's Parents' Meet Cute: 4274AE

Gashna's (Grimdash's orcish father) tribe was raiding the ruined settlement of Midmire when he decided to spare Tella's (Grimdash's human mother) life.
It was nearing the end of the orcs' victorious raid, and they were pillaging the remains of the wildling camp when Gashna discovered Tella hiding.
Tella was a powerful druid, and prepared to defend herself by transforming into a brown bear.
They fought a hard battle.
With each strike that Tella landed, Gashna fell more in love with this strong beast of a woman.
As Tella was about to strike the final blow, Gashna's tribe-mates rushed to his aid and Tella fled.
In his defeat, Gashna was left for dead by his tribe-mates, who scorned all that they found to be weak.

Tella later returned to see if there was anything worth scavenging from the remains of her tribe's camp.
Instead, she found Gashna, still clinging to life on the battlefield where she had felled him.
She brought him back from the brink of death, taking pity on his situation.
He explained that his life was hers: not only had she bested him in battle, she had won his heart as well.

They "settled" (somewhat nomadic to avoid the orcs in the area) near the Moonlit Grotto, which is where Tella's druidic circle met once a month on the full moon.
This Circle was concerned because they saw the orcs as a threat to the natural resources they would need as their population would continue to grow.
The Circle would stage guerilla-style attacks on the orcs when they had the chance, and Gashna began joining them on these raids.

## Grimdash' Birth: 4276AE

Gashna convinces Tella during her pregnancy that they needed to (at least temporarily) stop participating the raids on the orcs so they could raise their child.
Tella gives birth to Grimdash and they begin a little family.

## Gashna and Tella's Death: 4279AE

When Grimdash was about 3 years old, the orcs finally caught up to his family.
Tella flew with Grimdash, dropped him off with a wolf pack she was allied with, and rushed back to help Gashna.
That was the last that Grimdash or his pack ever saw of Tella.
The wolf pack took Grimdash in as one of their own and raised him with to be a druid like his mother.

Tella's druidic circle still exists and despises the unnatural monsters that result from Yelena's experiments 

## Present Time: 4294AE

- An alliance has finally been formed between the orcs and the Kumerovian Triad
- Kumerovians, Lizardfolk, and Zinoplastic weapons have started flowing into orcish cities

## Big Bad Evil Plot

- Yelena Kasradze is one of The Three fiercely loyal to Avnal who is obsessed with experimenting with zinoplasm on living creatures.
- Has been performing experiments for thirty years, is starting to get effective with them
- The party will follow in the wake of her progress as they cross the Scarred Lands:
  - Phase Spider at Webbed Lair
  - Lesser Giant(s) at Crumbled Cave
  - Wyvern at Dripping Caverns
    - **[TODO]** Party should probably witness this one so they can understand what's going on
- Yelena's ultimate goal is to perfect her ritual to infuse Avnal with the power of zinoplasm to make him the ultimate magical weapon.
