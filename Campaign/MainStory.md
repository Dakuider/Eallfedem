# Main Story

## Backstory: 2693 - 4262

1. There was a group researchers (humans) from the northeastern province of Arcmont called Kumerov that studied Zinoplasm during the Calamitous War to try and weaponize it.
1. Most of researchers and their research was destroyed during The Fall, but some survived.
1. The lingering Kumerov researchers were steeped in grief over the lost of their province and loved ones, and continued their research when they relocated to Ironbrook in 2962 AE.
1. The War of Bhelvaengr decimated Ironbrook in 3647 AE, including much of the Kumerov researchers' work.
1. The few Kumerov researchers who were left escaped into the Vetrupyr Wastes and travelled along the foot of the mountains, eventually stumbling across a Young Blue Dragon named Avnal.
Rather than fight Avnal, they decided to make a pact with Avnal:
  - Avnal would grant their three most adept magic users sorcerous powers
  - In return, The Three would ally their forces with Avnal to bring destruction and tyranny to the civilized world
1. Allied with Avnal, The Three and their forces travelled back to Ironbrook to establish their dominance over the resident wildlings and conscripting them to work the mine that Ironbrook was named after.
  - There were portions of this mine that were cordoned off because of the uncovering of zinoplasm, but these fonts of the magical material were now the focus of the miners' work.
  - This mine also provided The Three and their researchers with the materials they needed to study zinoplasm (such as platinum).
1. As time would pass, members of The Three would pass away, and were either replaced with
  - their offspring if they inherited the sorcerous power
  - the next most powerful magic user, granted new sorcerous power by Avnal

## Elyas' Birth: 4262AE

- Elyas' dad Murtaz is one of The Three and his mother Sonya is a Kumerov researcher.
- Something happens to Murtaz **[TODO]**
  - first experiment to turn 
- Sonya ran away with Elyas shortly after this.

## Devden's Discovery: 4272AE

Malak's mother Zoya is one of the Kumerov researchers.
The Order of the Tome sensed Avnal's power growing, but were unsure of what it was and sent Malak's father Devden to investigate.
Realizing the danger posed by the Order of the Tome, The Three satiated Deven's questions about the zinoplasm resources without telling him _why_ they were researching.
During his time there, Devden ended up falling in love with Malak's mother Zoya, a researcher.

## Elyas Skips Town: 4272AE

Elyas accidentally kills his friend at the age of 9 using his latent sorcerous powers, and flees town fearing retribution.

## Malak's Birth: 4273AE

While Malak is growing inside Zoya, she allows Yelena to conduct experiments because of the latent magical power that resides in elven blood.
Malak's birth was gruesome due to the magic caused by these experiments and Zoya died in childbirth.
  - **[REVIEW]**: does she though? Devden said otherwise...
Enraged by being lied to, and fearing for Malak's safety, Devden fled with Malak to Tomespire.
Thinking it would be the safest place, Devden left Malak in the hands of the Mirhem Academy while he continued his own research on zinoplasm.

## Grimdash's Parents' Meet Cute: 4274AE

Gashna's (Grimdash's orcish father) tribe was raiding a wildling camp when he decided to spare Tella's (Grimdash's human mother) life.
It was nearing the end of the orcs' victorious raid, and they were pillaging the remains of the wildling camp when Gashna discovered Tella hiding.
Tella was a powerful druid, and prepared to defend herself by transforming into a brown bear.
They fought a hard battle.
With each strike that Tella landed, Gashna fell more in love with this strong beast of a woman.
As Tella was about to strike the final blow, Gashna's tribe-mates rushed to his aid and Tella fled.
In his defeat, Gashna was left for dead by his tribe-mates, who scorned all that they found to be weak.

Tella later returned to see if there was anything worth scavenging from the remains of her tribe's camp.
Instead, she found Gashna, still clinging to life on the battlefield where she had felled him.
She brought him back from the brink of death, to grill him for information on his tribe.
He willingly told her all he knew, and explained that his life was hers: not only had she bested him in battle, she had won his heart as well.

## Grimdash' Birth: 4276AE

Tella gives birth to Grimdash.

## Gashna and Tella's Death: 4279AE

When Grimdash was about 3 years old, a wildling tribe found them.
  - **[TODO]** Grimdash's parents killed by zinoplasm weapons tests?
Tella flew with Grimdash, dropped him off with a wolf pack she was allied with, and rushed back to help Gashna.
That was the last that Grimdash or his pack ever saw of Tella.
The wolf pack took Grimdash in as one of their own and raised him with to be a druid like his mother.

Tella's druidic circle still exists and despises the unnatural monsters that result from Yelena's experiments 

## Present Time: 4294AE

-  The researchers have recently become successful in weaponizing zinoplasm because of newfound platinum in the mine they have the wildlings working. 
- They've used these weapons to arm some of the wildlings and unite them under their cause of wreaking destruction on the civilized world.
- At the direction of the researchers, the wildlings have been taking the weapons out into the Scarred Lands to test them on various monsters and tribes that don't want to join them.

## Big Bad Evil Girl and her Plot

- Yelena Kasradze is a researcher fiercely loyal to Avnal who is obsessed with experimenting with zinoplasm on living creatures.
- Has been doing experiments for some time, is starting to get effective with them
- Some creatures in the Scarred Lands are result of these experiments:
  - Phase Spider at Webbed Lair
  - Giant(s) at Crumbled Cave
  - Wyvern at Oldcrest
    - **[TODO]** Party should probably witness this one so they can understand what's going on
- Yelena's ultimate goal is to perfect her ritual to infuse Avnal with the power of zinoplasm to make him the ultimate magical weapon.
