## Elyas' Dream

- Notice scrying check (Perception / Arcana)
  - if Elyas succeeds check, notices slight reflection overlaid over top of dream
  - reflection is of Avnal (blue dragon)

- notice scrying check: DC20

- Elyas sees "himself" (actually Murtaz) performing a zinoplasm ritual
- Zoya is helping Murtaz with the ritual
- ritual is being performed on an animal, and is successful
- Zoya congratulates Murtaz and asks when they'll begin experiments on humans
- Murtaz expresses safety concerns and that the focus should be on making sure the ceremony would be safe for Avnal
- this seems to upset Zoya, and she pushes Murtaz into the pit
- Murtaz gets spat out by the pit covered in zinoplasm corruption and seemingly dead
- Zoya seems indifferent and just takes note of what occurred

_dream transition_ 

- notice scrying check: DC16

- fast forward to a pregnant Sonya being upset over what happened to Murtaz in hospital bed
- Zoya claims Murtaz tried to experiment on himself, but Sonya is only one suspicious of her
- montage of Sonya being accosted by friends of Zoya and fleeing Ironbrook
- montage ends in Sonya giving birth in Clintwood

_dream transition_

- notice scrying check: DC12

- montage of Elyas' childhood
- Sonya's voice saying "knowledge is power" in Kumerovian
- Elyas kills his friend at young age
- montage continues to show scenes of Elyas conning people
- shows Elyas meeting the "Wolfpack"
- shows Elyas striking the killing blows he's had so far, and donning the Bloody Pauldron of Leadership

_montage fades to black_

- notice scrying check: DC8
- Avnal's reflection slowly says: "I see... it would seem that knowledge _is_ power"

_dream ends_
