## Notes

- Malak is at threshold of 1-2 for wild surges
- Everyone has waited out their exposure to zinoplasm


## Grimdash' Druidic Callings

 - ambience: https://youtu.be/krl4XVqrqs8

- Grimdash had a dream of following the spectral form of Tilla's wild shape to the Moonlit Grotto
- Upon arriving, the party was accosted by Lyle
- Once Lyle recognized Grimdash, they were greeted relatively warmly and lead inside the Moonlit Grotto
- The other members of the Circle of the Moon arrived:
  - Keros via the Luan River
  - Enna and Kieran together
- Enna greeted Grimdash warmly once she realized who he was (she was good friends with Tilla and Gashna)
- During Circle meeting, Enna reports her and Kieran's spy mission was successful:
  - they discovered the Triad and the orcs have become allies
  - the result of this alliance is a monstrous orc (Tanarukk)
- Party explains to druids that Triad is researching zinoplasm weapons and aberrations
- Druids react poorly upon finding out Elyas can read Kumerovian
- Lyle suggests messing up the new alliance as a way of combating the Orcs / Triad


## Help Action(s)

- Pretend to be Triad emissaries (or one emissary with prisoners)


## Sneak Past Orcish Problem

- Consequence(s)
  - Hurt the party's relationship with the druids
  - End up with Lyle dying

- Ask druids for help?
  - Yes -> Enna/Kieran would go with them
    - Druids would offer two options:
      - Try and sneak through Orcish territory
        - high chance of Orcs capturing them
        - easier pace because flat/temperate climate
        - potential for grassland random monster encounters
      - Go all the way around to travel through the Dirkenmos Forest
        - safe, but very slow
        - potential for forest random monster encounters
  - No -> Party would have to decide what path to take
    - Mountain path
      - little chance of Orcs finding them
      - slow pace because mountains/cold
      - potential for mountainous random monster encounters
    - Through Orcish territory
      - will need to go through skill challenge to find path
      - same as with druids, but druids give advantage on stealth rolls


## Turn the Orcs Against the Triad

- Consequence(s):
  - Have to figure out what to do with Orcs post Triad confrontation
  - Potential to have Lyle die (if they mess up)

- Lyle would help party (if asked)

Orc-Triad alliance is based on
- first shipment of zinoplasm weapons (10-20 weapons)
- successful ritual to turn orc war chief into Tanarukk
- promise of loot through destruction of civilization

- Convince Orcs that weapons are faulty
- Convince Orcs that Triad is just using the Orcs / will turn on them
- Convince Orcs that Tanarukk is under Triad's control / will turn on the Orcs
- Kill Tanarukk and assume control of the Orcs through display of power


## Wildling - Orcish War

- Keros would help party (if asked)

- Unite the wildling population (Kilkenny, Ducelden, and Millstone) to go to war against the Orcs to take back their homeland


## Orcish Patrol Encounter

 - 2d6 Red Fangs of Shargaas on Giant Bats ambush them
 - if party defeats orcs, go to **Trial by Combat**


## Trial by Combat

- will have to fight Tanarukk in the Straflan Ruins colosseum
- colosseum would still have pit of zinoplasm that was used to create the Tanarukk
- might need to balance with either multiple Tanarukks or more orcs?


## Party's Imprisonment

- when party takes rest within 10 miles of Straflan Ruins, 


# Return to Lillied

## Devden's Imprisonment

**[TODO]**

## Rivas' Imprisonment

- if guards successfully arrest Rivas, he'll be brought to prison underneath the Sheriff's Manor
- Sheriff's manor security:

  - one sentry patrolling around manor
  - two sentries in basement prison
  - basement prison has powerful Dispel Magic enchantment


## Sheriff's Offer

- Sheriff Thrane will offer to remove Rivas' bounty of 2d4 gold (+20% interest) with three options:
  - pay the bounty
  - serve time worth one day per gold
  - bring corrupt tax collector to justice
    - suspects docks tax collector embezzles money
