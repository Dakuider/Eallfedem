## Grimdash' Druidic Callings

- Grimdash had a dream of following the spectral form of Tilla's wild shape to the Moonlit Grotto
- Upon arriving, the party was accosted by Lyle
- Once Lyle recognized Grimdash, they were greeted relatively warmly and lead inside the Moonlit Grotto
- The other members of the Circle of the Moon arrived:
  - Keros via the Luan River
  - Enna and Kieran together
- Enna greeted Grimdash warmly once she realized who he was (she was good friends with Tilla and Gashna)
- During Circle meeting, Enna reports her and Kieran's spy mission was successful:
  - they discovered the Triad and the orcs have become allies
  - the result of this alliance is a monstrous orc (Tanarukk)
- Party explains to druids that Triad is researching zinoplasm weapons and aberrations
- Druids react poorly upon finding out Elyas can read Kumerovian
- Lyle suggests messing up the new alliance as a way of combating the Orcs / Triad
