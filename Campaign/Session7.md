## Grimdash' Druidic Callings

 - ambience: https://youtu.be/krl4XVqrqs8

- Grimdash had a dream of following the spectral form of Tilla's wild shape to the Moonlit Grotto
- Upon arriving, the party was accosted by Lyle
- Once Lyle recognized Grimdash, they were greeted relatively warmly and lead inside the Moonlit Grotto
- The other members of the Circle of the Moon arrived:
  - Keros via the Luan River
  - Enna and Kieran together
- Enna greeted Grimdash warmly once she realized who he was (she was good friends with Tilla and Gashna)
- During Circle meeting, Enna reports her and Kieran's spy mission was successful:
  - they discovered the Triad and the orcs have become allies
  - the result of this alliance is a monstrous orc (Tanarukk)
- Party explains to druids that Triad is researching zinoplasm weapons and aberrations
- Druids react poorly upon finding out Elyas can read Kumerovian
- Lyle suggests messing up the new alliance as a way of combating the Orcs / Triad


## Strategy Discussion with Druids

- With Lyle's suggestion about breaking up alliance, Enna reveals that
  - some of the orcs are unhappy with the alliance
  - these orcs immediately challenged the war chief turned Tanarukk (named Zilug)
  - Zilug struck down the leader of the orcs that challenged him with ease
- Enna offers that if Zilug were killed, the alliance would likely fail and the power vacuum could present a major opportunity

- Keros speaks up at this point
  - he's swam past the Straflan Ruins many times on his way to join the Circle
  - he's noticed an entrance to some sewers that seem to have run dry over years of being unused
  - suggests that this could be a sneaky way into Straflan Ruins to attempt to assassinate Zilug

- Lyle thinks for a little bit and then...
  - asks Elyas if he can speak Kumerovian or if he knows *anything* about the culture
    - Elyas makes a DC10 History check
      - if he succeeds, he'll remember a phrase from his childhood that his mother would sometimes say: "knowledge is power"
      - if he fails, he only vaguely remembers "hello"
  - asks Enna that if during the spy mission she noticed the Triad members speaking Kumerovian
  - suggests that maybe they could disguise the party
  - Elyas as a Kumerovian that captured Malak and Grimdash

- At this point, Kieran changes back into his human form
- He suggests that the party just leaves, and runs back to Ironbrook, where Elyas belongs
- Enna rolls her eyes at this
- Lyle frowns and says
  - the party is welcome to be on their way to deal with the threat in Ironbrook
  - the druids can handle the Orcs
  - however, moving through Orcish territory will be dangerous


## Travelling Through Orcish Territory

- Roll for weather at beginning of each day based on DMG 109
- If party continues to travel after combat, each travel segment they must succeed a DC12 Constitution saving throw or gain a level of exhaustion

- *Perception*
  - in general for random encounters, mobs will roll stealth against player's passive perception
  - party can have option to roll perception at beginning of each travel segment to replace their passive

- *Navigation*
  - party navigator rolls Survival
  - navigator has advantage if they have a guide, or they can perceive a landmark
    - _0-5_: party makes 3 miles of progress in 2 hours 90 degrees rotated from Ironbrook
      - even: south / odd: north
    - _6-11_: party makes 6 miles of progress in 2 hours 45 degrees rotated from Ironbrook 
      - even: south / odd: north
    - _12-19_: party makes 6 miles of progress in 2 hours directly towards Ironbrook
    - _20_: party makes 6 miles of progress in 2 hours in ideal direction
    - successful check results in party

- *Stealth*
  - party as whole makes Stealth check
  - if party average beats random encounter's average passive perception, they avoid the encounter
  - otherwise...
    - thru Strael Mountains
      - random encounter: **Griffon Encounter**
      - every travel segment, players must succeed DC12 (DC8 for Grimdash) Constitution saving throw or gain a level of exhaustion
