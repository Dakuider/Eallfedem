## Backstory

Grimdash's parents' relationship was star-crossed because the orcish and human tribes were almost always in conflict.
Mixing of the races was to spit in the face of ancestors that had fought for the safety of their tribes for generations.

Gashna's (Grimdash's orcish father) tribe was raiding a wildling camp when he decided to spare Tella's (Grimdash's human mother) life.
It was nearing the end of the orcs' victorious raid, and they were pillaging the remains of the wildling camp when Gashna discovered Tella hiding.
Tella was a powerful druid, and prepared to defend herself by transforming into a brown bear.
They fought a hard battle.
With each strike that Tella landed, Gashna fell more in love with this strong beast of a woman.
As Tella was about to strike the final blow, Gashna's tribe-mates rushed to his aid and Tella fled.
In his defeat, Gashna was left for dead by his tribe-mates, who scorned all that they found to be weak.

Tella later returned to see if there was anything worth scavenging from the remains of her tribe's camp.
Instead, she found Gashna, still clinging to life on the battlefield where she had felled him.
She brought him back from the brink of death, to grill him for information on his tribe.
He willingly told her all he knew, and explained that his life was hers: not only had she bested him in battle, she had won his heart as well.

Gashna and Tella eventually ended up having a half-orc child: Grimdash.

When Grimdash was about 3 years old, a wildling tribe found them.
Tella flew with Grimdash, dropped him off with a wolf pack she was allied with, and rushed back to help Gashna.
That was the last that Grimdash or his pack ever saw of Tella.
After a time, members of the pack investigated the scene where Grimdash's parents were ambushed.
They found Gashna dead, surrounded by enemies, but could not find Tella.

The wolf pack took Grimdash in as one of their own and raised him with to be a druid like his mother.
The pack had planned to tell Grimdash that his mother could still be alive when they thought he was old enough to go out in the world on his own, but didn't get the chance before they were murdered as part of a zinoplasm weapons test.

Tella *is* still alive (47 years old at present time).
She was taken captive by the wildling raiding party that ambushed them.
After years of slavery, she managed to escape the wildling tribe.
She wasn't able to find Grimdash because at this point, the pack had already migrated to a new hunting location.

## TODO:

- what has Tella been up to all these years?
