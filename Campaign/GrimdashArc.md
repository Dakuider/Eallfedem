## Backstory

Grimdash's parents' relationship was star-crossed because the orcish and human tribes were almost always in conflict.
Mixing of the races was to spit in the face of ancestors that had fought for the safety of their tribes for generations.
Gashna (orcish father) and Tella (human mother) decided to run away together to avoid the scorn of their respective tribes.
While on the run, they had a half-orc child: Grimdash.

Their fugitive lifestyle worked well for them, and they learned to live as one with nature.
When Grimdash was about 3 years old, a human wildling tribe found them.
The tribe murdered Gashna on the spot, took Tella into custody, and left Grimdash at his parents camp to die.

A pack of wolves witnessed these tragic events and decided to take Grimdash into their pack to continue to raise him with druidic principles in mind.

The pack of wolves that raised Grimdash made their hunting grounds about 15 miles north of Fort Soleil in the Strael Mountains.
Grimdash's pack being slaughtered was one of the weapon tests.

## Todo

 - are either of Grimdash's parents alive? If yes, the party should run into them at some point during their travels in the Scarred Lands

## Session 0.5

### Scene 1 - Tragic Beginnings

Our attention pans to a lone figure making his way from trading with the elves at Fort Soleil, and making his way back to his home in the wild.

Andrew can formally describe Grimdash here.

> You make your way through the foothills and gain altitude, and you feel the familiar cold of the mountains start to seep into your clothes.
> You approach the outskirts of your pack's hunting grounds.

Make a DC10 perception or survival check.
On success: you hear a stampeding herd of elk approaching your location and are able to get out of the way.
On failure: take 1d4 bludgeoning damage as the herd of elk push their way past you.

Continuing on to your pack's location, you notice that the familiar scents of your pack are tinged with blood and char.
You come upon a horrific scene in the clearing.
The bodies of your pack mates are strewn about, and it seems they've been murdered.

A DC12 investigation check will reveal these following immediately, otherwise by the time you're done the sun is beginning to set.

Investigating the bodies reveals

- you determine the means of your packmates' deaths to be from purple scorch marks all over their bodies
- you find a set of armor amongst the bodies (add Armor of Beasts to your inventory)
- _if you touch the scorch marks_: a spark shoots from the wound and shocks what you touched it with

Investigating the surrounding area reveals

- humanoid footprints at a distance from where your pack's bodies are
- purple scorch marks on the area across from the footprints
- DC18 - droplets of zinoplasm near the footprints

You head to Fort Soleil to report this to the guards.

- DC16 persuasion
