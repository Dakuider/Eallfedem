## Backstory

Grimdash's parents' relationship was star-crossed because the orcish and human tribes were almost always in conflict.
Mixing of the races was to spit in the face of ancestors that had fought for the safety of their tribes for generations.
Gashna (orcish father) and Tella (human mother) decided to run away together to avoid the scorn of their respective tribes.
While on the run, they had a half-orc child: Grimdash.

Their fugitive lifestyle worked well for them, and they learned to live as one with nature.
When Grimdash was about 3 years old, a human wildling tribe found them.
The tribe murdered Gashna on the spot, took Tella into custody, and left Grimdash at his parents camp to die.

A pack of wolves witnessed these tragic events and decided to take Grimdash into their pack to continue to raise him with druidic principles in mind.

The pack of wolves that raised Grimdash made their hunting grounds about 15 miles north of Fort Soleil in the Strael Mountains.
Grimdash's pack being slaughtered was one of the weapon tests.
