## Backstory

The pack of wolves that raised Andrew made their hunting grounds about 15 miles north of Fort Soleil in the Strael Mountains.
Andrew's pack being slaughtered was one of the weapon tests.

## Todo

 - are either of Andrew's parents alive? If yes, the party should run into them at some point during their travels in the Scarred Lands
