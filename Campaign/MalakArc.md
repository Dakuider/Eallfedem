## Backstory

Caleb's mother is one of the Kumerov researchers.
The Order of the Tome sensed the earliest of weapon tests happening and sent Caleb's father to investigate.
The group hid the purpose of their research from him and only gave him enough to satiate his questions about the power that the Order sensed.
During his time there, Caleb's father ended up falling in love with Caleb's mother and conceiving Caleb.

Around the same time that Caleb was born, Caleb's father figured out why the faction was studying the Zinoplasm.
Afraid for his new-born's son's life and disgusted with Caleb's mother's lies, he fled the group and brought Caleb back to Tomespire.
When Caleb was a young boy, his father sent him to the Mirhem Academy.
