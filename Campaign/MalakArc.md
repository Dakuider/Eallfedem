## Backstory

Malak's mother (Zoya) is one of the Kumerov researchers.
The Order of the Tome sensed the earliest of weapon tests happening and sent Malak's father (Devden) to investigate.
The group hid the purpose of their research from him and only gave him enough to satiate his questions about the power that the Order sensed.
During his time there, Devden ended up falling in love with Zoya and conceiving Malak.

Around the same time that Malak was born, Devden figured out why the faction was studying the Zinoplasm.
Afraid for his new-born's son's life and disgusted with Zoya's lies, he fled the group and brought Malak back to Tomespire.
When Malak was a young boy, Devden sent him to the Mirhem Academy.

Students are gathered in a courtyard practicing low level charms and wards on each other.
Class seems to be going well, and the courtyard is alive with the sounds of students speaking spells aloud and flourishing their hands to perform the spells' somatic components.
There's one particular student that stands out as different amongst his classmates.

Caleb can formally describe Malak here.

After he successfully casts one of the spells they're practicing, things take a turn.

Caleb rolls on the wild magic surge table.
