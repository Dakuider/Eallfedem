# Plot Outline

1. There was a faction of humans from the northwestern province of Arcmont that studied Zinoplasm during the Calamitous War to try and weaponize it.
1. Most of this faction and their research was destroyed during The Fall, but some survived.
1. This lingering faction is steeped in grief over their province and their lost comrades and loved ones and continue their research in secret.
    - This faction relocated to the Dirkenmos City.
1. At some point along the line, some of this group decide to make a pact with a Blue Dragon to help them harness the power of Zinoplasm. In return, they would serve the dragon by decimating society and helping her rule over what's left.
    - Blue Dragon fits here because they inhabit deserts/badlands (i.e. Vetrupyr Wastes)
    - Blue Dragons == lightening damage which is a lot of what Zinoplasm does
    - Blue Dragon's layer is located in the wastes near the Zinoplasm mine this faction makes use of.
    Said location is about 40 miles west-north-west of the Dirkenmos City.
1. During the War of Bhelvaengr, the faction's dragon patron protected them from Bhelvaengr, but the Dirkenmos City was still mostly left in ruins (save the faction's research facilities).
1. Due to the last several hundred years being unhindered by needing to hide their research, the faction has started becoming successful in weaponizing Zinoplasm.
1. As their weapon tests have become more successful, they've started to use this power to convince wildlings to join their cause of destroying the civilized world.

## Stewie's Plot Ties

Stewie will be a descendant of one of the members who made the pact with the Blue Dragon.

Stewie fled his hometown at the age of 9, running from the percieved threat of the citizens seeking retirbution for him committing manslaughter on his childhood friend.
Stewie's hometown is located about midway along the road between Bloomington and Lakerest.
The woods he fled into are the southern Lasfaedon Woods.

## Andrew's Plot Ties

The pack of wolves that raised Andrew made their hunting grounds about 15 miles north of Fort Soleil in the Strael Mountains.
Andrew's pack being slaughtered was one of the weapon tests.

## Caleb's Plot Ties

Caleb's mother is one of the faction's scientists.
The Order of the Tome sensed the earliest of weapon tests happening and sent Caleb's father to investigate.
The group hid the purpose of their research from him and only gave him enough to satiate his questions about the power that the Order sensed.
During his time there, Caleb's father ended up falling in love with Caleb's mother and conceiving Caleb.

Around the same time that Caleb was born, Caleb's father figured out why the faction was studying the Zinoplasm.
Afraid for his new-born's son's life and disgusted with Caleb's mother's lies, he fled the group and brought Caleb back to Tomespire.
When Caleb was a young boy, his father sent him to the Mirhem Academy.
