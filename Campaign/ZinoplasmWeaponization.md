# Plot Outline

1. There was a group researchers (humans) from the northeastern province of Arcmont called Kumerov that studied Zinoplasm during the Calamitous War to try and weaponize it.
1. Most of researchers and their research was destroyed during The Fall, but some survived.
1. The lingering Kumerov researchers were steeped in grief over the lost of their province and loved ones, and continued their research when they relocated to Ironbrook in 2962 AE.
1. The War of Bhelvaengr decimated Ironbrook in 3647 AE, including much of the Kumerov researchers' work.
1. The few Kumerov researchers who were left escaped into the Vetrupyr Wastes and travelled along the foot of the mountains, eventually stumbling across a Young Blue Dragon named Avnal.
Rather than fight Avnal, they decided to make a pact with Avnal: in exchange for the sorcerous power necessary to harness Zinoplasm, they would serve Avnal by decimating society and helping her rule over what's left.
    - Blue Dragon fits here because they inhabit deserts/badlands (i.e. Vetrupyr Wastes)
    - Blue Dragons == lightening damage which is a lot of what Zinoplasm does
    - Avnal's layer is located in the wastes near a Zinoplasm mine.
    Said location is about 40 miles west-north-west of Ironbrook.
1. The Kumerov researchers would eventually re-adopt Ironbrook as their home, making use of the desolation of the War of Bhelvaengr by conscripting the survivors of Ironbrook to work the mine the town was named after.
1. The researchers have recently become successful in weaponizing zinoplasm because of newfound platinum in the mine they have the wildlings working. 
1. They've used these weapons to arm some of the wildlings and unite them under their cause of wreaking destruction on the civilized world.

## Stewie's Arc

Stewie fled his hometown at the age of 9, running from the perceived threat of the citizens seeking retribution for him committing manslaughter on his childhood friend.
Stewie's hometown is located about midway along the road between Bloomington and Lakerest.
The woods he fled into are the southern Lasfaedon Woods.

Todo:
 - Stewie will be a descendant of one of the members who made the pact with the Blue Dragon.
    - How did Stewie's mother come to interact with these researchers?
    - Why is Stewie's father not around anymore?
    - Did Stewie's mother escape from the other researchers with Caleb's dad? If this is the case, then who is Stewie's dad?

## Andrew's Arc

The pack of wolves that raised Andrew made their hunting grounds about 15 miles north of Fort Soleil in the Strael Mountains.
Andrew's pack being slaughtered was one of the weapon tests.

Todo:
 - are either of Andrew's parents alive? If yes, the party should run into them at some point during their travels in the Scarred Lands

## Caleb's Arc

Caleb's mother is one of the Kumerov researchers.
The Order of the Tome sensed the earliest of weapon tests happening and sent Caleb's father to investigate.
The group hid the purpose of their research from him and only gave him enough to satiate his questions about the power that the Order sensed.
During his time there, Caleb's father ended up falling in love with Caleb's mother and conceiving Caleb.

Around the same time that Caleb was born, Caleb's father figured out why the faction was studying the Zinoplasm.
Afraid for his new-born's son's life and disgusted with Caleb's mother's lies, he fled the group and brought Caleb back to Tomespire.
When Caleb was a young boy, his father sent him to the Mirhem Academy.
