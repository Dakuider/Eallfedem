## Backstory

Elyas fled his hometown at the age of 9, running from the perceived threat of the citizens seeking retribution for him committing manslaughter on his childhood friend.
Elyas's hometown is located about midway along the road between Bloomington and Lakerest.
The woods he fled into are the southern Lasfaedon Woods.

He's been making his way running cons on the people of the Florir Plains.
His go-to con is to disguise himself as a League of Sheriffs tax collector and collect money from unsuspecting citizens.

## Todo

    - How did Elyas's mother come to interact with these researchers?
    - Why is Elyas's father not around anymore?
    - Did Elyas's mother escape from the other researchers with Caleb's dad? If this is the case, then who is Elyas's dad?

## Session 0.5

### Scene 1 - The Con

Townsfolk are gathered in the town center of Tranquility, going about their daily tasks.
Farmers are selling their crop, people are trading goods they've made by hand, and generally the square bustles with activity.
Away from the center of attention, a tax collector is talking to some of these townsfolk.

Stewie can formally describe Elyas here.

Elyas role plays some his con on some citizens.

Make a DC10 perception check.

On a successful check, Elyas notices a group of Shireguard members making their rounds of the marketplace with a wanted poster with his picture on it.
On a failed check, the Shireguard members surround Elyas and confront him about the wanted poster.

This should end in Elyas fleeing town to make his way to Lillied, where he gets drunk at the Dancing Pistachio.

### Scene 2 - Drunk??

Give Stewie the option to role play getting drunk at the Dancing Pistachio.
