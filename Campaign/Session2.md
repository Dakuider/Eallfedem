  - 20(ish) years ago, Devden was sent on archaeological mission to the ruins of Ironbrook
  - discovered a group of researchers and wildlings
    - working mine
    - researching zinoplasm
  - he stayed with the group to
    - determine where they were in their research
    - surmise whether the Order needed to intervene
  - while he was there he fell in love with Malak's mother, Zoya

  - Devden reveals to party orcs took three amulets he made that were enchanted to vibrate in the presence of zinoplasm
