# Lathander, goddess of Truth and the Light of the Sun
### Neutral Good, Light domain

Lathander gazed upon the existing star that cast its dim light over the chaotic world below and decided something must be done.
With her mastery of the power of the Light of the Sun, she breathed new life into the star so that it would shine down upon the Material Plane to eradicate shadow and reveal only truth.

The All-Father saw this and allowed Lathander to enter Ysgard.
