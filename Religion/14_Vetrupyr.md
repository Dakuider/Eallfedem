# Vetrupyr, Goddess of the Wind and Fire
### Chaotic Evil, Tempest domain

Vetrupyr fought alongside the peoples of Arcmont during the Calmitous War.
For striking down her brother at the end of the war, The Allfather stripped her of much of her power and banished her from ever returning to Ysgard.
Vetrupyr is credited with the creation of the volcanoes that in turn created what is now known as the Vetrupyr Wastes.
