# Kol Korran, god of Wealth and Trade
### Neutral, Trickery domain

Kol Korran wandered the lands of Eallfeden and found that miles below the surface of the earth, there were grand caverns that Dunatis had created when he covered up the old world from before the Founding Familyâ€™s arrival.
Kol Korran found ruins of the civilizations that walked the old world, as well as some living members.
He allowed them to witness him depositing great wealth in the form of gems, crystals, and precious metals within the caverns and throughout the earth.
He told them about the surface that they could come to if they were tired of living beneath the earth.

As these ancient peoples began populating Eallfeden, Kol Korran walked among them and taught them to trade with one another and founded the city of Midlatrexan on Arcmount so that it could be a center of wealth, trade, and culture.

The All-Father saw this and allowed Kol Korran to enter Ysgard.
