# Aegir, god of the Sea and Storms
### Lawful Evil, Tempest domain

Aegir saw this new realm of stone that his brother had created, and decided it was lacking.
He conjured a colossal storm which filled the lowlands with oceans and started the never ending cycle of storms that would bathe the lands above the sea in water.

The All-Father saw this and allowed Aegir to enter Ysgard.
