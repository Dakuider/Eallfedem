# Žinóti, god of Magic and Secrets
### Chaotic Neutral, Knowledge domain

Žinóti imbued Eallfedem with magic in the form of žinoplasm, a substance pulsing with magical energy.
He embedded žinoplasm deep in earth, creating ley lines of power that criss-crossed the land.

The All-Father saw this and allowed Žinóti to enter Ysgard.
