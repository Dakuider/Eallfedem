# Dunatis, god of Land and Stone
### Neutral, Nature domain

The light of the sun now truly revealed the world below, and Dunatis was displeased with chaos and misery that he saw there.
He hurled rock after rock from the Earth Plane into the Material Plane to form the lands of Arcmont and the surrounding continents, burying the existing civilizations in miles and miles of stone.
He named this new world Eallfedem (Dominion of the All-Father).

The All-Father saw this and allowed Dunatis to enter Ysgard.
