# Silvanus, god of Forests and Beasts
### Chaotic Good, Nature domain

Silvanus looked upon the barren land and seas his brothers had created and decided it was lacking.
He brought Eallifedem to life with vast forests and wondrous creatures.

The All-Father saw this and allowed Slivanus to enter Ysgard.
