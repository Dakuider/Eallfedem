# Imhotep, god of Scholarship and Crafting
### Lawful Neutral, Knowledge domain

Imhotep walked the earth with the elves and imparted on them his love of Scholarship so that theyâ€™d be driven to learn more about Eallfedem.
He also showed them how to craft beautiful implements and abodes so that they could live in harmony with nature.
This resulted in the founding of the Order of the Tome and the elves building a beautiful civilization attuned with nature in the Lasfaedon Forest.

The All-Father saw this and allowed Imhotep to enter Ysgard.
