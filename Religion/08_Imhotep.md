# Imhotep, god of Scholarship and Crafting
### Lawful Neutral, Knowledge domain

Imhotep walked the earth with the elves and emparted on them his love of Scholarship so that theyâ€™d be driven to learn more about Eallfedem.
He also showed them how to craft beautiful implements and abodes so that they could live in harmony with nature.

The All-Father saw this and allowed Imhotep to enter Ysgard.
