# Tyr, god of Strength and Valor
### Lawful Good, War domain

Tyr walked among the humans that appeared on the Schateren Islands and taught them how to weather the stormy sea that beat upon their shores and the winds that howled from the north.
Their civilization flourished.

The All-Father saw this and allowed Tyr to enter Ysgard.
