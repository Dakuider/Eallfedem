# Tyr, god of Strength and Valor
### Lawful Good, War domain

When a group of humans and the frost giants that enslaved them emerged on the Schateren Islands, Tyr saw this and thought it unjust.
He decided to lead the humans in a rebellion against their oppressors.
When the last giant fell, Tyr looked upon his following of mighty warriors and was proud.
As a reward for their valor, and to make sure his people were never conquered again, Tyr took the blood of the fallen giants and infused it into the veins of his warriors.
Thus the Nordic Race was born.

The All-Father saw this and allowed Tyr to enter Ysgard.
