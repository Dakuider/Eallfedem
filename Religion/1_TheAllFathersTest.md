# The Test of the All-Father’s Children
### Circa ~8000 Before Elves (BE)

The All-Father created 12 children and bestowed upon each of them great power over certain domains.
He watched his children grow and become more comfortable with the powers they had been given.
As young gods and goddesses, unfortunately, all they managed to do was wreak havoc upon Ysgard, their home plane of existence.

Angered with his family and the numerous calamities they had caused, The All-Father cast them into the Material Plane and set upon each of them a test: if they could show mastery over their given domains, he would allow them back in to Ysgard to live by his side.
Until they showed mastery, they would be forced to walk among the material plane as outcasts.
He hoped that this experience would give his children humility and allow them to become the gods they were meant to be.

For the first few thousand years, The All-Father watched in dismay as his children wrought their havoc over the Material Plane.
However, the children began to miss their home and take their father’s test more seriously.
