# Bishamon, god of War and Conquest
### Lawful Evil, War domain

Bishamon walked amongst the humans on the continent of Solantis and instilled in them the desire of his domains.
Bishamon became a dominant part of their culture as they developed their civilizations and began to conquer the land.

The All-Father saw this and allowed Bishamon to enter Ysgard.
