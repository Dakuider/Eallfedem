# The Before Time
### Circa ???

Before the All-Father cast his children into the Material Plane, the lands were already inhabited by great beings of ancient legend such as the giants and dragons, who dominated the lands and were constantly at war with each other.
The humanoids that existed were enslaved by one great race or another, whether it be the Mind Flayers, the Aboleths, or some other powerful group of beings.
What little is known of this time is riddled with misery and war.
