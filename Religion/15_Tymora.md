# Tymora, Goddess of Luck and Games (a.k.a. "The Twelfth Child")
### Chaotic Neutral, Trickery domain

Tymora walked among the peoples of Arcmont and showed them how to gamble and play.
She had such fun with these games of luck that she decided to continue to stay on the Material Plane, rather than rejoin her family in Ysgard, whom she was convinced was no fun at all.
It is said that she still walks the earth as a hooded figure to preside over games of chance and offer unsuspecting travelers great rewards should they beat her in a game.
