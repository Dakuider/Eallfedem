# Demeter, goddess of Life and Fertility
### Chaotic Good, Life domain

Demeter saw that the halflings had lost their love of things that grow during the hundreds of years that they spent beneath the earth.

She walked among them and showed them the power of her sister's creation (the sun) and taught them how to reflect this power on the world around them.
With this power, the halfling's communities flourished.

The All-Father saw this and allowed Demeter to enter Ysgard.
