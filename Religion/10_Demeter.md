# Demeter, goddess of Life and Fertility
### Chaotic Good, Life domain

Demeter saw that the halflings had lost their love of things that grow during the hundreds of years that they spent beneath the earth.
She walked among them and showed them how to once again till the earth and build cheerful communities.

The All-Father saw this and allowed Demeter to enter Ysgard.
