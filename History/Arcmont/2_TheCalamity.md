## The Calamitous War
### Circa 2693 AE

Nephthys, God of Death and Rebirth, (LE Life domain), had become frustrated watching his family reunite in Ysgard while he had failed to produce anything that could please his father.
He blamed the All-Father for his failures, seeing his given dominions as only tools of destruction.
In his frustrations he cast a great curse of undeath upon Arcmount that caused every dead creature to rise from its grave and attack the living.
The war would last for centuries and ravage the lands.

## Zinoplasm Weaponization Experiments

Deep into the Calamitous War, a group of people from the region which would later become the Vetrupyr Wastes discovered a vein of Zinoplasm.
Hearing of the success of the gnomes and dwarves in harnessing it's energy for production, they began to study making use of it as a weapon.
It's believed that these experiments were unsuccessful, and any research left behind by this group was lost during The Fall.

## Vetrupyr Intervention
### Circa 2759 AE

Vetrupyr, Goddess of the Wind and Fire, (CE Tempest domain), watched as this war ravaged Arcmount and drained the courage of the forces of the living.
In hopes of winning her father’s favor, she joined the ranks of the living and rallied them with the passion of Fire.
Under her leadership, the living eventually drove the forces of undead into the northeast corner of the continent over a period of many years.
Finally, it seemed that an end to the war was near.

## The Fall of Nephthys and Vetrupyr
### Circa 2766 AE

In the final battle of the Calamitous War, the forces of life had what remained of the undead surrounded and it seemed that victory was near.
Seeing his great revenge against his father soon to become a failure like so many of his other ventures, Nephthys took his place on the battlefield and began to turn the tide of the battle by raising every fallen soldier of the living to join his ranks of undead.
Seeing the victory she thought would grant her access to her home being taken away fueled a great fury in Vetrupyr.
She lashed out in anger and called forth a great eruption of fire from within the earth, engulfing the entire army of undead in flames and tearing the very battlefield asunder.
Lava spewed forth from the earth in such grandeur that a colossal volcano formed right where Vetrupyr had directed her anger; where her brother was standing on the battlefield.
The All-Father did not take his son’s demise well.
Coming forth from the heavens he stripped Vetrupyr of most of her celestial powers and banished her from ever returning to their family’s home.
Vetrupyr pleaded with him to change his mind, trying to convince him that she was only trying to save life on Arcmont, but the All-Father’s decision was final.
This fratricide was an unforgivable sin and would be punished by making the immortal Vetrupyr walk the Material Plane for all eternity.
The same rage that had killed her brother boiled within Vetrupyr once more and she continued to call forth eruptions from the earth.
These eruptions ravaged the corner of Arcmont where the final battle of the Calamitous War had taken place.
Those living forces that were lucky enough to escape this fit of wrath tell stories of the ashen wastes they ran from, and the five volcanoes that surround Mount Nephthys that they believe symbolized Vetrupyr’s newfound hate of the races she had fought alongside.
