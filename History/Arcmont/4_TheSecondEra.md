# The Second Era
### Circa 3000 -

A period of primarily growth and prosperity, but not entirely free of conflict.

## The War of Bhelvaengr
### Circa 3647 - 3662 AE

A black dragon named Bhelvaengr and a legion of lizardfolk emerged from the Blackmire.
They quickly overran the communities of humans that lived on what are now referred to as the Scarred Lands.
Some humans managed to escape the attack, but many were killed or captured and enslaved by the dragonkind.
The humans warned the Lasfaedon elves and the people of the Florir Plains of the attack and they were much more prepared when the dragonkind moved on to attack their civilizations.
The elves, the strongest of the fleeing humans, and a small percentage of heroic-minded halflings met the dragonkind on the battlefield and a war raged on for 15 years.
The war left the eastern Florir Plains scarred and riddled with mass graves of humans, elves, lizardfolk, and halflings.
To end the war, a powerful group of elven mages performed a binding spell on Bhelvaengr to lock him back in the Elder Caverns from which he had come.
Most of the lizardfolk followed their master, but some are said to have remained in the swamp, waiting and hoping that one day Bhelvaengr would return for revenge on the elves.

## The Ryuu Empire Landing
### Circa 4111 AE

Upon learning that there were new lands to be conquered, the Empire that dominated the continent of Solantis began to expand onto the southwestern coast of Arcmont.
They deemed this area the Dragon Coast (based on its cartography and in honor of their god Bishamon's role in the War with Nessus).
They brought with them a culture of strict laws, a thirst for conquest, and a practice of enslaving the tiefling race.
