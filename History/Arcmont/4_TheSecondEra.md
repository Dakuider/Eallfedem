# The Second Era
### Circa 3000 -

A period of primarily growth and prosperity, but not entirely free of conflict.

## The War of Bhelvaengr
### Circa 3647 - 3662 AE

A black dragon named Bhelvaengr and a legion of lizardfolk emerged from the Blackmire.
They quickly overran the communities of humans that lived on what are now referred to as the Scarred Lands.
Some humans managed to escape the attack, but many were killed or captured and enslaved by the dragonkind.
The humans warned the Lasfaedon elves and the people of the Florir Plains of the attack and they were much more prepared when the dragonkind moved on to attack their civilizations.
The elves, the strongest of the fleeing humans, and a small percentage of heroic-minded halflings met the dragonkind on the battlefield and a war raged on for 15 years.
The war left the eastern Florir Plains scarred and riddled with mass graves of humans, elves, lizardfolk, and halflings.
Once the League of Sheriffs was formed, their unified forces combined with the power of their newfound allies in the Lasfaedon Elves (who saw their territory come under threat of war) pushed the forces of Bhelvaengr back across the Scarred Lands.
The war ended with the death of Bhelvaengr, who was defeated in an epic battle in the eastern Scarred Lands.
The lizardfolk scattered into the Dirkenmos Forest, and the forces of the League and Lasfaedon retreated back behind the safety of the Lasfaedon River, making little to no effort to rehabilitate the humans who had become slaves of Bhelvaengr.

## The Ryuu Empire Landing
### Circa 4111 AE

Upon learning that there were new lands to be conquered, the Empire that dominated the continent of Solantis began to expand onto the southwestern coast of Arcmont.
They deemed this area the Dragon Coast (based on its cartography and in honor of their god Bishamon's role in the War with Nessus).
They brought with them a culture of strict laws, a thirst for conquest, and a practice of enslaving the tiefling race.
