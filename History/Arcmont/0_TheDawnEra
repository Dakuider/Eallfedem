# The Dawn Era
### Circa 0 - 1000 After Elves (AE)

The dwarves came forth and began hewing great cities from the mountains and diving deep back into the earth in search of the riches they witnessed Kol Korran deposit.
Gnomes sprang forth and began finding places for their hidden communities.
Even some humans and halflings had survived Dunatis’ stone deluge and came to the surface to rebuild their communities in the light of the Sun.
Those more magically attuned may also have felt great evil shifting in the depths of the Elder Caverns.

## The Crossing of the Elves
### Circa 0 AE

A Feywild crossing that the god Žinóti created allowed elves to cross over and begin trickling into the world to inhabit it.
The crossing they came through was located at Lacudin Lake and they would protect it and the surrounding forest with their powerful magic.
