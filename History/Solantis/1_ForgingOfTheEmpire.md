## The Tiefling Deal
### Circa 3418 AE

In their thirst for power one kingdom of Solantis decided to make a deal with the archdevil Asmodeous.
The king and his mages would complete a ritual of dark magic to create a portal to allow the armies of the Nine Hells onto the continent of Solantis.
In return, they and their kingdom would be given infernal power (and become what is now known as the Tiefling race) and would rule alongside the devil armies’ leaders.

## The War with Nessus
### Circa 3419 - 3508 AE

The army of tieflings and devils quickly gained the upper hand in the conflicts the kingdom has been involved in.
Upon seeing this great darkness enter the land over the course of several years, many of the other kingdoms decided to form an alliance united under King Sudeiman Visregh to put a stop to what would surely be the doom of the Solantians.
The war lasted for almost a century, but the alliance under King Sudeiman was eventually victorious.
Following this victory and the closing of the portal to Nessus, the tieflings were enslaved as recompense for their actions.
Additionally, the alliance outlawed the worship of and interaction with any deity besides Bishamon.

## Founding of the Visregh Empire
### Circa 3536 AE

The alliance recognized King Sudeiman’s leadership as a key factor in their victory.
At a meeting of all of the former kings, they decided to establish the Visregh Empire.
The Empire quickly grew on the backs of their new tiefling slaves and expanded across the continent of Solantis, assimilating cooperative kingdoms as they went.
Uncooperative kingdoms and communities were added to the Empire as slaves.
