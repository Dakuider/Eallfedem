## The Tiefling Deal
### Circa 3418 AE

In their thirst for power, one kingdom of Solantis made a deal with the archdevil Asmodeous.
The king and his mages would complete a ritual of dark magic to create a portal to allow the armies of the Nine Hells onto the continent of Solantis.
In return, they and their kingdom would be given infernal power (and become what is now known as the Tiefling race) and would rule alongside the devil armies’ leaders.

## The War with Nessus
### Circa 3419 - 3508 AE

The army of tieflings and devils quickly gained the upper hand in the conflicts the kingdom was involved in.
Upon seeing this great darkness enter the land over the course of several years, an opposing kingdom petitioned their god, Bishamon, for help in the War with Nessus.
Bishamon answered this petition by appearing on the material plane as a powerful golden dragon and leading the petition kingdom in war.

The other kingdoms at war with the forces of Nessus joined the ranks of the kingdom led by Bishamon to form a mighty alliance to put a stop to what would surely be the doom of the Solantians.
The war lasted for almost a century, but the alliance under Bishamon was eventually victorious.

## Founding of the Ryūjin Empire
### Circa 3510 AE

Following this victory and the closing of the portal to Nessus, several historical events took place:

 - Bishamon bestowed upon the original petitioning kingdom great power that resulted in them becoming the Ryūjin (Dragonborn) race.
 - Bishamon decreed that the other kingdoms would follow the Ryūjin and from a mighty Empire to conquer Eallfedem.
 - Bishamon denounced the Tiefling kingdom and decreed that they and their decendants were to be enslaved as recompense for their actions.
 - Bishamon then ascended from the material plane back to his family in Ysgard.

Along with following these decrees, the newly founded Ryūjin Empire outlawed the worship of and interaction with any deity or extra-planar beings besides Bishamon.
The Empire quickly grew on the backs of their new tiefling slaves and expanded across the continent of Solantis, assimilating cooperative kingdoms as they went.
Uncooperative kingdoms and communities were added to the Empire as slaves.
