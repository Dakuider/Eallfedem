# League of Sheriffs

A loose confederacy of cities made up of Bloomington, Lillièd, and Outer Mirhem.
The cities rely on each other for trade, and should one come under a major attack, the others would rally to help in the defense.
Each of the cities is governed by an elected Sheriff.
The Sheriff’s primary charge is to provide protection in the form of the Shireguard, but also collects taxes and performs administrative and judicial duties.

## Military: Shireguard

In response to the attacks of a dragon and its followers hundreds of years ago, the League assembled a military force deemed the Shireguard.
The proud remnants of this force now patrol the streets of the cities they defended in the war.
