# Ryuu Empire

A large Empire forged in a great war on Solantis, that thirsts to conquer.
The Empire is ruled by the Emperor from Solantis, and each province of the Empire is ruled by a Daimyo that is subordinate to the Emperor.
Emperors and Daimyo alike are chosen from the families of the Dragonborn, who hold the highest social status in the Empire.
Samurai are also typically Dragonborn, but there have been some human Samurai as well.

The competitve culture of the warring kingdoms transgressed governments, and positions of power amongst the Dragonborn are decided via martial combat, including the position of Emperor.
That being said, martial combat only takes place when current position holders pass away or are deemed unfit to rule.
It would be considered dishonorable to challenge a sitting Emperor, Daimyo, or Samurai if they were in good standing with their constituents.

## Military: Ashigaru

Each Daimyo choose several Samurai that lead the military that in turn collects taxes, police the citizens, and keeps their communities safe.
