## Lili√®d Port

A bustling center of maritime commerce where the Lacudin River meets the sea on the southern coast of the Florir Plains.
The southeast portion of this city is fairly industrial, in order to support the busy docks that dominate the shore of the ocean.
As the city stretches north along the Lacudin River, it becomes more residential and agricultural.
Where these two sides of everyday life meet in the middle of the city is the market, where people buy and sell just about anything one could think of.

The portion of the city bordering the drawbridge that spans the Lacudin River is rather heavily fortified and garrisoned by the Shireguard, who stand watch against the dangers of the Scarred Lands.
