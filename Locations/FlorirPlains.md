## Bloomington

## Lili√®d Port

A bustling center of maritime commerce where the Lacudin River meets the sea on the southern coast of the Florir Plains.
The southeast portion of this city is fairly industrial, in order to support the busy docks that dominate the shore of the ocean.
As the city stretches north along the Lacudin River, it becomes more residential and agricultural.
Where these two sides of everyday life meet in the middle of the city is the market, where people buy and sell just about anything one could think of.

The portion of the city bordering the drawbridge that spans the Lacudin River is rather heavily fortified and garrisoned by the Shireguard, who stand watch against the dangers of the Scarred Lands.

### The Singing Pistachio

The tavern that's closest to the city's market center, and therefore typically the one with the most patrons.
The tavern's owner is Susanna Shepherd.

## Settlements

I used the following rules for rolling settlements: roll a d4, a d6, and a d12.
The d4 determined the population (100 to 400).
The d6 determined the type of town, based on the list below:

- 1 = farming
- 2 = mining
- 3 = farming
- 4 = built on ruins
- 5 = farming
- 6 = mining

The d12 determined the distance between the new settlement and the last settlement/city.

### Starlight

A settlement of ~200 people built on ruins.

### Eastwood

A farming settlement of ~300 people.

### Goldfield

A mining settlement of ~100 people.

### Mossy Rock

### Tranquility

### Bedrock Burrows
