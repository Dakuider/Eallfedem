# The Scarred Lands

Following The War of Bhelvaengr, the eastern Florir Plains became known as the Scarred Lands, as they were the setting for most of the battles that took place.
At present time, they are patrolled by roving bands of wildling humans (descendants of those that were enslaved by the dragonkind) and orcs that moved in to fill the void that the war had left.

## Dirkenmos Forest

The eastern border of the Scarred Lands is a damp and dreary forest.

## Blackmire

To the east of the Scarred Lands is Blackmire, a swamp that stretches for miles to the eastern coast of Arcmont.

## Ruins of Coastal City

## Ironbrook City

A city named for the babbling mountain brook and the iron mine that it was founded around at the base of the Strael Mountains.

## Ruins of Central City

## Wilderness Dungeons

I used the following rules for rolling dungeons: roll a d12, two d10s, and a d8.
The d12 determined the distance between the new dungeon and the last.
One d10 determined how far off of the road the dungeon was (even left, odd right).

The d8 determined the type of dungeon:

- 1-2: abandoned / ruined settlement
- 3-4: mass grave / mausoleum
- 5-6: abandoned / ruined fortress
- 7-8: monster lair

The other d10 determined the inhabitants of the dungeon:

- 1-3: wildlings
- 4: orcs
- 5-6: group of monsters
- 7-8: higher CR monster
- 9-0: empty
