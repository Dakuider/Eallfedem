# The Scarred Lands

Following The War of Bhelvaengr, the eastern Florir Plains became known as the Scarred Lands, as they were the setting for most of the battles that took place.
At present time, they are patrolled by roving bands of wildling humans (descendants of those that were enslaved by the dragonkind) and orcs that moved in to fill the void that the war had left.
