# Ausrad Hills

Forever tinged with the golden color of fall, the Ausrad Hills roll on for hundreds of miles west of the Bindenroc Mountains.

The Nordic Expansion Wars left the hills west of the [RIVER VALLEY] dotted with ruins of dwarven cities.
The entirety of the hills are home to countless abandoned mines (many of which goblins have taken residency in).

## Bindanroc Mountains

A mountain range stretching about 200 miles from north to south along a slightly bowed line, sectioning off the Ausrad Hills from the rest of Arcmont.
