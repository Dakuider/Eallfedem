# Lusel
### Lawful Neutral

## Appearance

Female human (wildling) in her 40s.
She's wearing filthy rags, but she has many tribal tattoos from when she was a wildling.


## Occupation / Daily Life?

She was a maternal leader in her wildling tribe, so she's taken a sort of leadership position amongst the slaves.

Slaves to the orcs are responsible for menial tasks such as...
- cleaning common areas.
- maintaining old and building new areas in the sewers for orcs to live in.

Slaves are kept in line with constant beatings; some desire their freedom, and some have resigned to their misery.


## Interaction

She comes off as **reserved**, but **resilient**.
She possesses a basic knowledge of masonry, because she once worked on the sewers of the Ducelden Ruins.


## Goal

To keep the slaves that look up to her alive and safe.


## Conflict

The constant beatings obviously threaten the safety of the slaves, but those that desire freedom often provoke their masters.


## Why do PCs care?

Lusel will be the primary slave the party interacts with.
