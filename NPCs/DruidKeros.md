# Keros "Protector of the Southern Aegirian Sea"
### Lawful Good

## Appearance

Male triton approaching 100 years old.
He wears armor seemingly made of fish scales and has blue skin and bright green hair.


## Occupation / Daily Life?

He preserves the natural order of the Southern Aegirian Sea.
Before he became a druid, he was a paladin amongst the Triton people.


## Interaction

Very **laid back** but is quick to **defend** his Circle comrades.


## Goal

They want to continue relaxing in the Southern Sea and go with the flow.


## Conflict

The increased presence of the orcs has pushed more wildlings south, and this threatens the balance of the Southern Sea.


## Why do PCs care?

_Do they have a rumor or secret to share?_
_Will this lead to a side quest or continue main plot?_
_Do they possess a magical item or secret the PCs would be interested in?_
_Will they offer the PCs something to complete a task?_
