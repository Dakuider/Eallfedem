# Luděk Řezníček
### Lawful Evil

## Appearance

Male human in his 50s.
Wears chainmail armor and sorcerer's cloak of the Kumerovians.
He's very athletically built for a sorcerer. 


## Occupation / Daily Life?

Leader of Kumerovian fighting force.
He's passionate about raw power and brute strength.
Currently, he's overseeing the alliance with the Orcs and serving as an envoy to Zilug.


## Interaction

Very **arrogant** and **dismissive** of party's chances of success in defeating him/Avnal.


## Goal

He wants to kill the party and recruit Elyas to be with the Kumerovians.


## Conflict

The party is obviously in the way of this, and he'd need to convince Elyas to betray his friends.


## Why do PCs care?

He'll let the party in on more of the plan:
  - praise for Avnal and excitement for the planned experiment
  - tells Elyas who his father was (and how it was rather mysterious that he died during an experiment with Zoya).
_Do they have a rumor or secret to share?_
_Will this lead to a side quest or continue main plot?_
_Do they possess a magical item or secret the PCs would be interested in?_
_Will they offer the PCs something to complete a task?_
