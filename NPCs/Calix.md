# Calix
### Chaotic Evil

After years spent in the Elder Caverns learning magic from Bhelvaengr, Calix returns to the surface.
Bhelvaengr has charged him with establishing a force strong enough to take on the elves so that they can destroy the Binding Gem safeguarded by the Arsene Guard.

## Backstory

As a boy of the wildling clans of the Scarred Lands, Calix stumbled upon an arcane tome.
After reading the tome cover to cover, he discovered he had a passion and talent for magic.
To fuel this passion, Calix asked his parents if there was anyone who could teach him more.

Calix’s parents explained that wildlings haven’t practiced magic for generations.
They also couldn’t turn to the settlements of the Florir Plains because the civilians there aren’t fond of the wildlings, and the elves of Lasfaedon forest see the wildlings as savages.
This developed Calix’s hate for the civilized world at an early age.
Throughout his developmental years he continued to try to learn magic at every opportunity.

As a teenager, Calix found a cave that led to the Elder Caverns.
After being ambushed by lizardfolk, they took him to their leader, Bhelvaengr the black dragon.
Sensing Calix’s hatred towards civilization and his arcane curiosity, Bhelvaengr decided that he’d be better left alive than tortured and eaten as typical prey.
Over time, Bhelvaengr taught Calix old powerful magic and continued to fuel his hatred of the civilization that shunned his people.
