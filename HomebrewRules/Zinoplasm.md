# Žinoplasm

Zinoplasm is a substance that the god Žinóti embedded in the earth of the world of Eallfedem that exudes magical energy.

## Locations of Zinoplasm

Veins of zinoplasm criss-cross the world of Eallfedem, typically miles below the surface of the earth.
Because of this depth, zinoplasm is generally only found in mines.

## Interaction with Zinoplasm

Being in proximity to zinoplasm affects living beings and magical items.
Exposure to zinoplasm is measured in Accumulated Exposure Units (AEUs), and it dependent upon time, distance, and shielding.

## Gaining Exposure Units

 - Coming into direct physical contact with Zinoplasm gives you 1 AEU per second of contact.
 - Being unshielded within 20 feet of Zinoplasm gives you 1 AEU per 6 seconds of proximity.
 - Every 20 foot interval of separation cuts the gained AEUs in half.
 - Every layer of adequate shielding cuts the gained AEUs in half.
    - Adequate shielding includes:
        - 10 feet of earth
        - 5 feet of water
        - 1 foot of wood
        - 4 inches of stone
        - 1 inch of steel
 - Thick enough layers of valuable metals completely block the gaining of AEUs:
        - 0.1 inches of platinum
        - thickness of other valuable metals are based on exchange rate table (pg. 143 in PHB)
 - Gained AEUs under 1/8 should not be tracked.

## Losing Exposure Units

 - Casting Dispel Magic on yourself removes 1 AEU, and an additional AEU for each level of spell slot used above 3rd-level.
 - For every 15 minutes spent not gaining AEUs, your active AEU count is reduced by 0.25.
 - For every 5 hit points healed, your AEU count is reduced by 0.25.

## Exposure Unit Effects

Some of your skin becomes a deep purple color and gives off a dim purple glow in the following order based on the number of AEUs you have: 

    1. Fingers and toes.
    2. Hands and feet.
    3. Forearms and calves.
    4. Upper arms and legs.
    5. Hips and groin.
    6. Abdomen.
    7. Chest.
    8. Shoulders and neck.
    9. Bottom half of head.
    10. Top half of head.

If you have 10 AEUs, make a Constitution saving throw (DC15).
On a failed save, you drop to zero hit points and are stable.
On a successful save, take 1d8 lightning damage.

When your number of exposure units increases by 1, roll a d20 and follow the instructions:

 - _1_: You take _n_d4 lightning damage, where _n_ is the number of AEUs you have.
 - _2-3_: You regain a spent spell slot, starting with the highest level spent spell slot you have. If you have no spent spell slots, a ball of lightning energy expands out from you in a 20 foot radius. Creatures inside the light must make a Constitution saving throw (DC10). On a failed save, the creature takes 1d8 lightning damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much.
 - _4-5_: A magical item you are carrying gains one charge. If this results in the the item having more than its maximum number of charges or the item doesn't have charges, the item becomes hot to the touch for the next minute and you take 1d4 lightning damage if you're touching it. If you have no magical items, follow the instructions for rolls _2-3_.
 - _6-12_: The spell Light (purple colored) is cast on you for the next minute.
 - _13-19_: The spell Blur is cast on you for the next minute.
 - _20_: You feel invigorated by magical energy. Roll one of your hit dice and increase your current and max hit points by the result.
