# Žinoplasm

Zinoplasm is a substance that the god Žinóti embedded in the earth of the world of Eallfedem that exudes magical energy.

## Locations of Zinoplasm

Veins of zinoplasm criss-cross the world of Eallfedem, typically miles below the surface of the earth.
Because of this depth, zinoplasm is generally only found in mines.

## Interaction with Zinoplasm

Being in proximity to zinoplasm affects living beings and magical items.
Exposure to zinoplasm is measured in units called Denmats (_dm_).
These are named after Gestin Denmat, the gnomish tinkerer who did the first experiments to understand zinoplasm.
Accumulating (or losing) _dm_ is dependent upon time exposed, distance to zinoplasm, and shielding from zinoplasm.

## Gaining Exposure Units

 - Coming into direct physical contact with Zinoplasm gives you 1 _dm_ per second of contact.
 - Being unshielded within 20 feet of Zinoplasm gives you 1 _dm_ per 6 seconds of proximity.
 - Every 20 foot interval of separation cuts the gained _dm_ in half.
 - Every layer of adequate shielding cuts the gained _dm_ in half.
    - Adequate shielding includes:
        - 10 feet of earth
        - 5 feet of water
        - 1 foot of wood
        - 4 inches of stone
        - 1 inch of steel
        - wearing a Zinoti Medallion
 - Thick enough layers of valuable metals completely block the gaining of _dm_:
        - 0.1 inches of platinum
        - thickness of other valuable metals are based on exchange rate table (pg. 143 in PHB)
 - Gained _dm_ under 1/8 should not be tracked.

It's often easier to measure _dm_ in _ddm_ (deci-Denmats).

| Combat Round Exposure  | No Shielding | 1 Shielding | 2 Shielding | 3 Shielding |
| ---                    | ---          | ---         | ---         | ---         |
| Touching zinoplasm     | 60 _ddm_     | 30 _ddm_    | 15 _ddm_    | 7 _ddm_     |
| w/in 20ft of zinoplasm | 10 _ddm_     | 5 _ddm_     | 2 _ddm_     | 1 _ddm_     |
| w/in 40ft of zinoplasm | 5 _ddm_      | 2 _ddm_     | 1 _ddm_     | --          |
| w/in 60ft of zinoplasm | 2 _ddm_      | 1 _ddm_     | --          | --          |

## Resistance to Exposure Units

For each consecutive 72 hour period spent with _dm_ > 0 or as a result of succeeding zinoplasm saving throws (described below), you gain one layer of "natural shielding" to zinoplasm, but the material begins to affect your mind and body permanently.
For each level of natural shielding, a portion of your body gives off a dim purple glow.
One layer of shielding allows you to ignore the "At 10 or more _dm_" section, but only if you've gone through the process once.
Two layers of shielding halves damage from zinoplasm effects, but the _confusion_ spell is cast on you (DC10) when you take damage in this way.
Three layers of shielding allows you to re-roll your effect d20 when determining zinoplasm exposure effects.
If you do, the _confusion_ spell is cast on you (DC13)
Four layers of shielding makes you immune to the effects of zinoplasm.

## Losing Exposure Units

- Casting Dispel Magic on yourself removes 1 _dm_, and an additional _dm_ for each level of spell slot used above 3rd-level.
- For every 15 minutes spent not gaining _dm_, your active _dm_ count is reduced by 0.25.
- For each collection of hit points healed equal to the max value of your hit die, your _dm_ count is reduced by 1.
  For example: being healed 8HP when your hit die is a d8 reduces your _dm_ count by 1.
  Being healed 4HP when your hit die is a d8 reduces your _dm_ count by 1/2.

## Exposure Unit Effects

Some of your skin becomes a deep purple color and gives off a dim purple glow in the following order based on the number of _ddm_ you have: 

- 10-19 _ddm_: Fingers and toes.
- 20-29 _ddm_: Hands and feet.
- 30-39 _ddm_: Forearms and calves.
- 40-49 _ddm_: Upper arms and legs.
- 50-59 _ddm_: Hips and groin.
- 60-69 _ddm_: Abdomen.
- 70-79 _ddm_: Chest.
- 80-89 _ddm_: Shoulders and neck.
- 90-99 _ddm_: Bottom half of head.
- 100+ _ddm_: Top half of head.

When your number of exposure units increases into a new threshold above, roll a d20 and follow the instructions on the table below.
When "_n_" is mentioned, it is the number indicated as the floor of the new threshold of _dm_.

 - _1_: You take _n_d4 lightning damage.   
 - _2-3_: You regain a spent spell slot, starting with the lowest level spent spell slot you have.
   If you have no spent spell slots, a ball of lightning energy expands out from you in a 10 foot radius.
   Creatures inside the lightning must make a Constitution saving throw (DC10).
   On a failed save, the creature takes _n_d4 lightning damage, where _n_ is the highest level .
   On a successful save, it takes half as much.
 - _4-5_: A magical item you are carrying gains one charge.
   If this results in the the item having more than its maximum number of charges or the item doesn't have charges, the item becomes animated (as if by the _animate objects_ spell) and take actions based on the _confusion_ table (re-roll a 9-10).
   If you have no magical items, follow the instructions for rolls _2-3_.
 - _6-12_: The spell Light (purple colored) is cast on you for the next minute.
 - _13-19_: The spell Blur is cast on you for the next minute.
 - _20_: You feel invigorated by magical energy.
   Roll one of your hit dice and increase your current hit points by the result (hit points over your maximum are temporary).

### At 10 or more _dm_

Whenever you start your turn with 10+ _dm_, you must make a special saving throw, called a zinoplasm saving throw.
Unlike other saving throws, this one isn't tied to any ability score.
You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.

Roll a d20 (with advantage if you're Malak).
If the roll is a 10 or higher, you succeed.
Otherwise, you fail.
A success or failure has no effect by itself.
Once you've accrued three successes or failures, you gain a layer of natural shielding to zinoplasm.
On your third success, you gain a layer of natural shielding to zinoplasm and a new special ability.
On your third failure, you gain a layer of natural shielding to zinoplasm, but you drop to 0 hit points.
The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind.
The number of both is reset to zero when you reduce your _dm_ to below 10.

_Rolling 1 or 20_: When you make a zinoplasm saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures.
If you roll a 20 on the d20, it counts as 2 successes.

#### Special Abilities

If you succeed your zinoplasm saving throws, your defining quality becomes enriched with magic and manifests itself in the form of changes to your appearance and magical abilities.

For example:
- A Giant Spider will become a Phase Spider, the ultimate hunter beast.
- An Orc will become a Tanarukk, the epitome of a raging warrior.

#### Grimdash's Special Abilities

- He can use his action to polymorph into a wolf-humanoid hybrid (MM 211).
- He gains proficiency in Stealth.
- His Strength becomes 15.
- His Hybrid form base AC is 13.

#### Elyas' Special Abilities

- He becomes Half-Dragon (MM 180).
- He gains blindsight with a radius of 10 feet and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet.
- He gains resistance to lightning damage.
- He can speak Draconic.
- He gains the Blue Dragon Wyrmling _Lightning Breath_ ability.

#### Malak's Special Abilities

***Ability Score Increase.***
Your Charisma score increases by 2.

***Lightning Resistance.***
You take half damage when the type is lightning.
In addition, effects resulting from zinoplasm can no longer damage you.

***Channel Energy***
You can cast the _shocking grasp_ cantrip as a bonus action.

***Celestial Connection***
This experience seems to have brought you closer to the gods; in particular, Žinóti.
You can speak, read, and write Celestial.

***Radiant Consumption.***
You can use your action to unleash the divine magical energy within yourself, causing a searing light and lightning to radiate from you, pour out of your eyes and moth, and threaten to char you.
Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action.
During it, you shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.
At the end of each of your turns, each creature with 10 feet of you takes lightning damage equal to half your level (rounded up).
You may choose to "overcharge" this radiance at the end of your turn to take lightning damage equal to half your level (rounded up) in order to deal lightning damage equal to your level to each creature within 15 feet of you.
In addition, once on each of your turns, you can deal extra lightning damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell.
The extra lightning damage equals your level.
Once you use this trait, it has a chance to recharge at the end of combat if you roll a 5-6 on a d6.
Otherwise, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Weapons:

### Arcblade
_Longsword, rarity unknown (requires attunement)_

A longsword made of platinum alloy with arcane runes inscribed along the flat of the blade.
