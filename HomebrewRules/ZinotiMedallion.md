# Zinoti Medallion

A platinum medallion in the shape of the god Zinoti's visage, with the eyes replaced with tiny purple amethysts.

### Effect

This amulet will vibrate when within 100 ft (regardless of shielding) of zinoplasm.
The vibration will increase in intensity proportionally to the distance to the zinoplasm.

One of these amulets worn by Malak will always softly vibrate (only enough for him to notice).
