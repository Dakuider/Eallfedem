# Zinoti Medallion

A platinum medallion in the shape of the god Zinoti's visage, with the eyes replaced with tiny purple amethysts.

### Zinoplasm Detection

This amulet will vibrate when within 100 ft (regardless of shielding) of zinoplasm.
The vibration will increase in intensity proportionally to the distance to the zinoplasm.

### Zinoplasm Shielding

This amulet provides the wearer with one layer of shielding from gaining AEUs.

### Malak's Connection

One of these amulets worn by Malak will always softly vibrate (only enough for him to notice).
